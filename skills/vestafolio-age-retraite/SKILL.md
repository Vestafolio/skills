version: 1.2.0
description: Simulate early retirement (FIRE) financed by invested capital for a French saver using Vestafolio's simulator API, after asking the simulator's questions (current situation, mortgage, target age, complementary income, lifestyle at retirement). Use when a user asks "à quel âge puis-je arrêter de travailler", "quand serai-je financièrement indépendant", at what age they can retire early, how much capital they need for FIRE, whether their savings will last, or how part-time income and expense cuts change their retirement age.

# Âge de retraite anticipée / FIRE (Vestafolio)

## Required workflow

For a request within this simulator's scope:

1. Reuse answers already supplied. Ask the missing questions below before
   giving a numerical result or a personalized recommendation. Example values
   and schema defaults are not the user's answers.
2. Once inputs are known, actually call a tool: fetch the schema, then POST
   the user's parameters. Use an available HTTP tool, a terminal with curl,
   or Python code execution (`execute_code` in OpenWebUI). Python can use
   `urllib.request`; in browser-based Pyodide use `await pyfetch(...)` from
   `pyodide.http`. A Python environment does not need a shell to call the API.
3. Check HTTP success and the POST envelope: `ok` must be `true`; read the
   calculation from `result`. Ground the answer in that output, state relevant
   assumptions and limits, and link the interactive simulator below.

Writing a code block is not execution. Do not substitute mental arithmetic,
remembered tax rules, or the worked example for a tool result. If execution
or network access is unavailable, or the API fails, say the calculation could
not be completed and provide the simulator link; do not invent its result or
recommendation. A schema GET alone is not a completed simulation.

## Response language

Reply in French whenever the user speaks or writes in French.

Simulates a capital-funded early retirement: year-by-year accumulation of
savings until the target retirement age (salary, expenses, mortgage,
investment returns), then withdrawals through retirement up to a life
expectancy of 86, with the required capital, goal status and improvement
levers. The model below is the one coded in the simulator; use it to
explain, and the API to compute.

## When to use

- "À quel âge puis-je arrêter de travailler ?" / "At what age can I retire early?"
- FIRE questions: capital needed, whether current savings + monthly surplus
  suffice, how long the capital lasts
- "What if I work 2 more years / cut expenses / keep a side gig?" follow-ups

## When NOT to use

- Statutory French pension rights (trimestres, âge légal, pension amounts) —
  this is a pure capital-drawdown simulation
- Choosing an investment envelope (use vestafolio-pea-vs-cto)
- Non-capital questions like budgeting alone

## Questions to ask before calling the API

The simulator asks these inputs, in this order. Ask or confirm each in
French; do not assume a default for a question marked (gate).

« Situation actuelle »

1. « Épargne disponible actuellement » → `currentSavings` (invested capital
   today).
2. « Salaire net mensuel » → `monthlyNetSalary`.
3. « Autres revenus (mensuel) » → `otherMonthlyIncome` (« Revenus locatifs,
   freelance, etc. »). Counted before retirement only — income kept after
   retirement must be entered again in question 11.
4. « Augmentation annuelle des revenus » → `annualSalaryIncrease` (%, applies
   to salary and other income).
5. « Dépenses mensuelles courantes » → `currentMonthlyExpenses` (« Ne pas
   inclure de crédit immobilier »).
6. « Mensualité de prêt immobilier » → `monthlyMortgagePayment` and, if it is
   > 0 (gate), « Nombre d'années restantes pour le prêt » →
   `remainingMortgageYears` (the site refuses a payment without a duration).
   The mortgage keeps being paid after retirement until it ends.
7. « Âge actuel » → `currentAge`.

« Projection »

8. « Âge de départ souhaité » (gate) → `desiredRetirementAge`, at least the
   current age (the API clamps it; the site shows an error).
9. « Rendement annuel des investissements avant fiscalité » →
   `annualInvestmentReturn` (%).
10. « Revenu complémentaire » (gate) → `hasPartTimeActivity` (Oui/Non; the
    site defaults to Oui with 600 €, so ask).
11. Only if Oui: « Revenu complémentaire (mensuel) » → `partTimeMonthlyIncome`
    (« Loyers perçus, pension, temps partiel »), « Hausse annuelle des
    revenus » → `annualPartTimeIncomeIncrease` (%), « Âge auquel ces revenus
    cessent » → `partTimeIncomeEndAge` (at least the retirement age; the API
    clamps it). If Non, send `partTimeMonthlyIncome: 0`.
12. « Maintien du niveau de vie » (gate) → `maintainLifestyle`. Only if Non:
    « Dépenses mensuelles courantes révisées » → `revisedMonthlyExpenses`
    (monthly expenses targeted at retirement). If Oui, send the current
    expenses in `revisedMonthlyExpenses` as well.

## Model as coded in the simulator

- Before retirement, each year: income = (salary + other income) × 12 grown
  by `annualSalaryIncrease` since today; expenses = current expenses × 12
  inflated at 3 %/year since today; mortgage = payment × 12 while years
  remain; net savings are added to the capital, which earns
  `annualInvestmentReturn` on the opening balance. A negative net saving is
  withdrawn grossed-up for tax.
- In retirement, each year until age 86: expenses (current or revised) × 12
  inflated at 3 %/year since today, plus the remaining mortgage, minus the
  complementary income (grown by its own rate since today, while the age is
  below `partTimeIncomeEndAge`); the shortfall is withdrawn from the capital
  grossed-up so that 31,4 % (PFU majoré: 12,8 % IR + 18,6 % PS) is paid on
  the withdrawal; a surplus is saved.
- `objectiveReached` = the capital never goes negative until 86 and the
  capital at retirement is at least `capitalNecessary` (the smallest capital
  that survives until 86, found by bisection).
- `sustainableUntilAge` extends the drawdown to 120 (`…IsCapped` when it
  lasts that long).
- `improvement` levers when the goal is missed, each on its own: extra work
  years to the first achievable retirement age (null if none before 86), the
  monthly expense cut that would make the goal reachable, or the number of
  years of a 800 €/month complementary income.

## How to call the API

Always fetch the canonical input schema first (fields, bounds, defaults):

```
GET https://www.vestafolio.com/api/tools/v1/age-retraite
```

Every field has a default, so a minimal call with just the user's key numbers
works — but confirm the defaults match their situation (notably the 600 €
complementary income). Then POST (amounts in euros, rates in percent):

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error --max-time 30 -X POST https://www.vestafolio.com/api/tools/v1/age-retraite \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "currentSavings": 120000,
    "monthlyNetSalary": 3500,
    "otherMonthlyIncome": 0,
    "annualSalaryIncrease": 1,
    "currentMonthlyExpenses": 1800,
    "monthlyMortgagePayment": 800,
    "remainingMortgageYears": 10,
    "currentAge": 40,
    "desiredRetirementAge": 53,
    "annualInvestmentReturn": 7,
    "hasPartTimeActivity": true,
    "partTimeMonthlyIncome": 600,
    "annualPartTimeIncomeIncrease": 1,
    "partTimeIncomeEndAge": 65,
    "maintainLifestyle": false,
    "revisedMonthlyExpenses": 1600
  }'
```

Unknown fields are rejected (strict schema) — if you get a `validation_error`,
re-read the schema from the GET endpoint rather than guessing field names.

## Interpreting the output

- `objectiveReached` — the headline verdict (site badge « Objectif atteint »
  / « Objectif non atteint »)
- `capitalAtRetirement` vs `capitalNecessary` — projected capital at the
  target age vs the capital actually required; `completionPercent` is their
  ratio (« Progression vers le capital nécessaire »)
- `sustainableUntilAge` — « Vous pouvez vivre de votre rente jusqu'à » N ans
  (« et + » when `sustainableUntilAgeIsCapped`)
- `improvement` — relay the levers as the site does (« Âge de départ
  atteignable », « Réduction de vos dépenses mensuelles », « 800 €/mois en
  revenu complémentaire »), saying « Non atteignable avec ce seul levier »
  for a null value
- `preRetirementProjection` / `retirementProjection` — year-by-year series
  for "what happens at age N" follow-ups; `minClosingCapital` below zero
  pinpoints when savings run out; the first retirement year with
  complementary income gives the monthly transition balance the site shows
- `inputs` — the normalized values actually used (ages clamped)

## Caveats

- Constant assumptions (returns, salary growth, 3 % expense inflation, flat
  31,4 % tax on withdrawals) — real sequences of returns and future tax law
  will differ. Estimates, not financial advice — say so.
- Ignores statutory pension income; from the légal retirement age onward the
  real situation is usually better than simulated.
